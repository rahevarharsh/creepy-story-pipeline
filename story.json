He spent days capturing the perfect light. But when he reviewed his photos back at his cabin, he saw something strange. In the deep background of every shot, pale, blurry figures stood between the trees. He thought it was just a trick of the light, until he noticed they were getting slightly closer in each photo. To test a theory, he set his camera on a timer and struck a pose, one hand on his hip. He took the shot. When he looked at the image, his heart stopped. Far behind him, one of the pale figures was perfectly copying his pose. He slowly lowered the camera, realizing the forest had gone completely silent.

No signal, no other cars. Just silence. After an hour, an old tow truck pulled up. The driver, a kind-looking old man, smiled and offered her a ride. She was hesitant, but he seemed harmless. As she got in, he said, 'Don't worry, Maya. We'll get you home to 142 Oak Street in no time.' She froze, asking how he knew her name and address. He just chuckled and pointed to her driver's license, which she'd left on the passenger seat. Relieved, she relaxed. But then, he started humming a quiet tune. It was a lullaby only her mother used to sing to her. He turned, his smile gone, and whispered, 'She always sang that to you, didn't she?'",

The engine was always dead silent, and its windows were tinted so dark you couldn't see a thing. No one ever got out. Just sat there. After weeks of this, the kid's curiosity turned to dread. He finally walked out and jotted down the rusted license plate number. When he looked it up on the station's old computer, his blood ran cold.

One afternoon, they found an old diary from a previous tenant hidden under the floorboards. The last entry read: 'The landlord was wrong. The breathing isn't coming from inside the room. It's coming from inside the walls. That door isn't meant to keep something in\u2026 it\u2019s the only way for it to get out.' Just then, they heard a jingle. The landlord had dropped the key.",

A single, dim, yellow light in the upstairs bedroom window, flickering on at the same time every night. It wasn't an electric light; it looked older, like a candle. I thought maybe a squatter had moved in, so one night, I grabbed my dad\u2019s old binoculars to get a better look.

He brought an old walkie-talkie, a childhood toy, for nostalgia. The first night was silent. But on the second, the device crackled to life. A voice, distorted by static but unmistakably his own, whispered through the speaker. He thought it was a recording, a strange prank. But then the voice said his name. It described the tear in his tent and the specific pattern on his sleeping bag. The voice grew panicked, begging him to leave. It kept repeating, 'It's not a reflection you see in the lake.' Frozen, the man asked who was speaking. The voice on the other end, his own voice, cried out, 'It's me. From tomorrow. Don't look in the water.'",

The old one hands him a tarnished silver whistle and whispers, 'Keep your eyes on the horizon. Never down.' The jungle outside is a wall of black, the only sound is the clatter of the wheels. The passengers sit silent, their faces pale in the dim light. The rhythm is hypnotic, pulling his gaze lower. He fights it, but for a single second, he glances down. The rain-slicked rails don't reflect the moon; they shimmer like a long, dark mouth opening. A cold wind, smelling of damp earth and something ancient, fills the cab. The train's steady rhythm falters, slowing into a mournful, dragging song. The silver whistle on the floor now looks dull and grey. From the last carriage, I can see the driver's seat is now empty.",

He crept towards the stage, where a heavy velvet blind covered the center. The legend said a singer was trapped behind it, forced to perform forever. He reached out, his hand trembling, and pulled the blind aside. There was nothing there but a dusty microphone stand. But then, the applause grew louder, aimed directly at him. He tried to turn back, but his feet felt glued to the floorboards. The curse was real: whoever reveals the performer must take their place. The price was already paid.
