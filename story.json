He spent days capturing the perfect light. But when he reviewed his photos back at his cabin, he saw something strange. In the deep background of every shot, pale, blurry figures stood between the trees. He thought it was just a trick of the light, until he noticed they were getting slightly closer in each photo. To test a theory, he set his camera on a timer and struck a pose, one hand on his hip. He took the shot. When he looked at the image, his heart stopped. Far behind him, one of the pale figures was perfectly copying his pose. He slowly lowered the camera, realizing the forest had gone completely silent. He wasn't just being watched; he was being mocked.",

The last pages didn't talk about the climb. They described the mountain as a living thing, with a 'slow, icy breath' and a 'deep, hungry groan.' She wrote that the wind whispered her name, begging her to come outside. The final entry, written in a shaky hand, read: 'The whispers are so close now. It promises warmth if I just let it in.'
