The goal wasn't just to hide your body, but to hide your shadow completely from the moonlight. My cousin, Leo, and I thought it was a silly, fun challenge. I found the perfect spot under a thick, dark bush where no light could touch me. But Leo wasn't so lucky. I watched from my hiding spot as the seeker found him. But it wasn't our friend, Sarah. It was a tall, thin figure that seemed to drink the light around it. It didn't touch Leo. It just stood on his shadow. Leo didn't scream. He just stood up, his eyes empty, and walked away with it. We never saw him again.",

He ran up to the dusty, forgotten attic and saw a large, old wooden wardrobe. It was the perfect hiding spot. He slipped inside, pulling the heavy door almost completely shut, leaving just a tiny crack. He waited, hearing the muffled shouts of his cousins searching below. But soon, the sounds faded. He heard the front door close and a car drive away. They had forgotten him. He pushed on the door, but it wouldn't budge. It had locked from the outside.

The only one left was Maya. He could hear faint giggling from the upstairs closet, but he remembered the rule and called out, 'Game over!' They all left, laughing about how Maya won. The next morning, Maya\u2019s parents called everyone, frantic. She never came home. The friends ran back to the house, their hearts pounding. They slowly opened the upstairs closet door. Maya wasn't there. But scratched into the back wall, in her handwriting, were the words: 'Don't look for me. It found me first.'",

I found the perfect spot under a thick, dark bush where no light could touch me. But Leo wasn't so lucky. I watched from my hiding spot as the seeker found him. But it wasn't our friend, Sarah. It was a tall, thin figure that seemed to drink the light around it. It didn't touch Leo. It just stood on his shadow. Leo didn't scream. He just stood up, his eyes empty, and walked away with it.

Start with ambient neighborhood sounds (crickets, distant traffic) and slowly fade in a low, unsettling drone as the story progresses. When the tall figure appears, cut the ambient sounds for a moment to create a jarring silence, then bring in a low hum. Use a subtle vignette and film grain overlay throughout to give it a found-footage or memory-like quality. The final shot should hold on the empty space for an extra second before fading to black.",

A group of cousins decided to play one last game before their parents came. The youngest, a boy named Leo, wanted to win so badly. He ran up to the dusty, forgotten attic and saw a large, old wooden wardrobe. It was the perfect hiding spot. He slipped inside, pulling the heavy door almost completely shut, leaving just a tiny crack. He waited, hearing the muffled shouts of his cousins searching below. But soon, the sounds faded. He heard the front door close and a car drive away. They had forgotten him. He pushed on the door, but it wouldn't budge. It had locked from the outside. They say the new family living there now sometimes hears a faint, rhythmic tapping coming from the attic.",
