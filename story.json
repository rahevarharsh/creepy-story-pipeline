He spent days capturing the perfect light. But when he reviewed his photos back at his cabin, he saw something strange. In the deep background of every shot, pale, blurry figures stood between the trees. He thought it was just a trick of the light, until he noticed they were getting slightly closer in each photo. To test a theory, he set his camera on a timer and struck a pose, one hand on his hip. He took the shot. When he looked at the image, his heart stopped. Far behind him, one of the pale figures was perfectly copying his pose. He slowly lowered the camera, realizing the forest had gone completely silent.

No signal, no other cars. Just silence. After an hour, an old tow truck pulled up. The driver, a kind-looking old man, smiled and offered her a ride. She was hesitant, but he seemed harmless. As she got in, he said, 'Don't worry, Maya. We'll get you home to 142 Oak Street in no time.' She froze, asking how he knew her name and address. He just chuckled and pointed to her driver's license, which she'd left on the passenger seat. Relieved, she relaxed. But then, he started humming a quiet tune. It was a lullaby only her mother used to sing to her. He turned, his smile gone, and whispered, 'She always sang that to you, didn't she?'",

The engine was always dead silent, and its windows were tinted so dark you couldn't see a thing. No one ever got out. Just sat there. After weeks of this, the kid's curiosity turned to dread. He finally walked out and jotted down the rusted license plate number. When he looked it up on the station's old computer, his blood ran cold.

A soft, rhythmic breathing from behind the door. It sounded wet, heavy. The student became obsessed, pressing their ear against the cold wood, feeling the faint vibrations. One afternoon, they found an old diary from a previous tenant hidden under the floorboards. The last entry read: 'The landlord was wrong. The breathing isn't coming from inside the room. It's coming from inside the walls. That door isn't meant to keep something in\u2026 it\u2019s the only way for it to get out.' Just then, they heard a jingle. The landlord had dropped the key.",
